# 🧪 Network Sniffing Lab

🚧 **Work in Progress**

This lab will provide a hands-on environment to safely practice and understand **network traffic sniffing**, packet analysis, and data interception techniques using tools such as Wireshark and tcpdump.

Topics will include:
- Capturing live network traffic
- Analyzing protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP)
- Identifying sensitive data in plaintext
- Understanding the security implications of unencrypted traffic

**Status:** Planned
