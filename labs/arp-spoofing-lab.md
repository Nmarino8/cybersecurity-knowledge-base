# 🧪 ARP Spoofing Lab

🚧 **Work in Progress**

This lab will provide a hands-on environment to safely practice and understand **ARP spoofing (ARP poisoning)** attacks, including how attackers intercept network traffic and perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on local networks.

Topics will include:
- Understanding the ARP protocol
- Performing ARP spoofing attacks in a controlled environment
- Intercepting and analyzing network traffic
- Identifying the risks of unsecured local networks
- Implementing defensive measures such as static ARP entries and network monitoring

**Status:** Planned
