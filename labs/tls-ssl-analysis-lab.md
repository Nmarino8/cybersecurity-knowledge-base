# 🧪 TLS/SSL Analysis Lab

🚧 **Work in Progress**

This lab will provide a hands-on environment to safely practice and understand **TLS/SSL protocols**, encrypted communications, and common misconfigurations that weaken transport-layer security.

Topics will include:
- Understanding the TLS/SSL handshake process
- Analyzing encrypted traffic and certificates
- Identifying weak cipher suites and protocols
- Detecting misconfigurations (e.g., outdated TLS versions)
- Using tools such as OpenSSL and Wireshark
- Implementing best practices for secure transport encryption

**Status:** Planned
